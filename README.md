# easyscreenocr-clone
Captures a part of the screen, reads the text from the captured image than translates and prints it to a target language. Currently from German to English, because I'm trying to learn German. You can easily change the "from" and "to" languages from the lines "60" and "98" in "visual_translation.py".
# Tutorial
(Screenshots are from the game "King's Bounty: The Legend", one of my favourite games.)

First, you've got to be in a screen where there is text to be screenshot of.

Third, you can select 2 green dots on the screenshot. These 2 green dots select the area between them and create a rectangle.

Fourth, you press enter, a window pops up with the text inside the rectangle you selected. You can adjust the captured text within this menu if wrong.
